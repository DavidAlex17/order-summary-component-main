## Acknowledgments

I do not have anyone in particular, although i guess i would give a shout out to my past self and past challenges. I always go back to similar code to improve my repetitive practice. i also, want to point out the great criticism i get between my challenges from other Frontend Mentor members, they also help me improve where i do not notice the most.
